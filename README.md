# html5upload

## Setup
Upload entire dir to your server. 
Add uploads/creds.php containing the following info (Security folks - I know what you're thinking. But it gets the job done.):

    <?php
    $USERNAME = 'foo';
    $PASSWORD = 'Barzx0x02!';

Change username and password to anything. Use this to login.
